Nucleation for Probabilistic Cellular Automata

In this github repository you can find the code for MCMC for PCA with self-interaction. Figure question1.jpg has to do with question 2.1.i). 

The other jpg file that I include is just a plot to see how the final spin configuration looks like in the self-interaction case.
