Nucleation for Probabilistic Cellular Automata

In this github repository you can find the code for MCMC for PCA with self-interaction (mcmc1) and without (mcmc2).

----> beta_specific() <----
is a matlab function that outputs the time evolution of magnetization, staggered magnetization and the spin configuration of a 2d system with size L, in a magnetic field h, with self-interaction kappa, with assumed spin value n for total time T with inverse temperature beta.

----> mcmc1 <----
is a matlab script with the desired values inserted by default for the first question of the project. It outputs the magnetization for 3 different temperatures and also the final spin configurations respectively.

----> mcmc2 <----
is a matlab script with the desired values inserted by default for the second question of the project. It outputs the magnetization for 3 different temperatures and also the final spin configurations respectively.
